# 🔢 ClojureScript Calculator

A **simple calculator app** built with **ClojureScript** and **Reagent** (a minimalistic React wrapper for ClojureScript). This project is part of my learning journey into functional programming, ClojureScript, and building clean, reactive web apps.

---

## ✨ Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: **Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide**
- Live result updates using **reactive state management**
- Built with **Reagent (React for ClojureScript)**
- Clean **functional programming approach**
- Simple and elegant **CSS styling**
- Live reload with **Figwheel**
